# topic-modeling-with-NMF
This project applies **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** for unsupervised topic modeling on a textual dataset using Python and NLP techniques.

## 📁 Files

- `Topic_Modeling_with_NMF.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook with full implementation.
- `topic_modeling_with_nmf.py`- Python script version for clean execution and integration.


## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand and apply **NMF** for topic modeling.
- Preprocess and clean raw text data.
- Extract and interpret dominant topics from a corpus.
- Visualize topic-word and document-topic distributions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- NLTK / spaCy
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🚀 Install Dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

---
## 🔍 Preprocessing Steps
- Text normalization (lowercasing, punctuation removal)
- Tokenization
- Stopword removal
= TF-IDF vectorization for input to NMF


## 📊 Results
- Top words per topic
- Topic distribution per document
- Visualizations of word weights and clusters
